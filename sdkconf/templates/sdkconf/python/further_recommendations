* **Preserving Local Variables** (optional): The SDK's default is to be quite conservative with the number of local
  variables it sends per frame (the default is is 10). If you want to see more, you may either proceed with the [monkey
  patching described in this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/377), or set
  `max_request_body_size` to `"always"` (which will send everything). Note that both these solutions may result in
  messages so large that they are dropped by the server. Because Bugsink is self-hosted, you can [adjust the server
  settings](https://www.bugsink.com/docs/settings/#maximums) to accept them anyway.
